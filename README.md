# Coin Catalogue

A mini React and Redux app that uses [Crypto Compare](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com)
to show up-to-date crypto data.

See it hosted on here on [Heroku](https://coin-catalogue.herokuapp.com/).

Features

- Updates automatically.
- Choose currency by the select but also by putting any currency symbol
  into the home url (eg. "/GBP").
- Choose a table to show more info. Also go to the route
  "/coin/:name/:cryptoSymbol/:currencySymbol" to see any other coin
  available from the api.
